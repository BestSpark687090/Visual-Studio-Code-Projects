# <p class="red">BestSpark687090's Visual Studio Code Projects</p>
<p class="white">Hello! I am BestSpark687090 and these are my projects!</p>

<p class="blue">Some examples of my projects are: </p>

* <ui class="red">2 Discord Bots with the help of Discord.JS</ui>
* <ui class="white">A Minecraft Bedrock Edition manifest.json Maker</ui>
* <ui class="blue">A TON of randomly named items</ui>
* <ui class="red">A full on Clicker Game!</ui>
> ### <h3 class="white">Note: The clicker game was made IN SCHOOL. It was made for no reason other than: "I want to make a clicker game,but i have no ideas so i'll ask one of my friends for ideas and keep them updated on how it goes."</h3>
* <ui class="blue">And a LOT more!
> ### <h3 class="red">Oh, and one time, I made Hello World with an array..
* <ui class="white">And that's about all of them!

> ### <h3 class="blue">If you see any folders with a .sln file, that was when I installed Visual Studio, not Visual Studio Code, so those ones are outdated in my opinion.

<p class="red">Thanks for reading this!</p>

<h2 class="white">Have a <strong>GREAT</strong> day!</h2>
