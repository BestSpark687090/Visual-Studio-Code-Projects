# BestSpark687090's Visual Studio Code Projects
Hello! I am BestSpark687090 and these are my projects!

Some examples of my projects are: 

* 2 Discord Bots with the help of Discord.JS
* A Minecraft Bedrock Edition manifest.json Maker
* A TON of randomly named items
* A full on Clicker Game!
> ### Note: The clicker game was made IN SCHOOL. It was made for no reason other than: "I want to make a clicker game,but i have no ideas so i'll ask one of my friends for ideas and keep them updated on how it goes."
* And a LOT more!
> ### Oh, and one time, I made Hello World with an array..
* And that's about all of them!

> ### If you see any folders with a .sln file, that was when I installed Visual Studio, not Visual Studio Code, so those ones are outdated in my opinion.

Thanks for reading this!

Have a <strong>GREAT</strong> day!

> ### P.S. Hey there! Just here to let you know that I recently got a new laptop, so that's why the programs with fs which grab the file off of my desktop will be added to the main folder of the repository. Thankfully, the laptop has more computer space than the old one. And i mean a **lot** more space than the old laptop.

```js
console.log("Thanks for reading all the way to down here! Or maybe you didn't.")
console.log("PS: I thought that CSS would work, but fsr it only works on Live Preview lol")
```
