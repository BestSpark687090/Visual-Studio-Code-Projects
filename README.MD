# BestSpark687090's Visual Studio Code Projects
Hello! I am BestSpark687090 and these are my projects!

Some examples of my projects are: 

* 2 Discord Bots with the help of Discord.JS
* A Minecraft Bedrock Edition manifest.json Maker
* A TON of randomly named items
* A full on Clicker Game!
> ### Note: The clicker game was made IN SCHOOL. It was made for no reason other than: "I want to make a clicker game,but i have no ideas so i'll ask one of my friends for ideas and keep them updated on how it goes."
* And a LOT more!
> ### Oh, and one time, I made Hello World with an array..
* And that's about all of them!

> ### If you see any folders with a .sln file, that was when I installed Visual Studio, not Visual Studio Code, so those ones are outdated in my opinion.

Thanks for reading this!

Have a <strong>GREAT</strong> day!
